# object_manipulation
This repository contains the implimentation of the an approach to grasp and manipulate unknown objects. It means that the robot did not have any perior knowledge about how to grasp the object and based on  the shape of the object tries to grasp it. This approach was initially published in an article with the name of "Object Learning and Grasping Capabilities for Robotic Home Assistants" in LNCS springer book.

In this impelimentation we used Robotis manipulator-H as our minpulator. The impelimetation trajecotry palaning and control are also aviable in this profile.
